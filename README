This old project is using CodeIgniter 1.6.1
Therefore you need PHP <= 5.2 ,
You may need to downgrade PHP in your system.

As the project has stopped in 2007,
I'm uploading it for legacy purpose only.

I currently (2011) continue this project
in other framework for learning purpose.

Have fun

Firebird Instruction

There is a sample database with fixtures that you can use.
First, extract sample database,
then add aliases in your firebird.

$ gzip -d YellowBook.sample.fdb.gz

Add aliases in 
/etc/firebird/2.5/aliases.conf
IluniBook = /var/www/your_directory/YellowBook.sample.fdb

$ /etc/init.d/firebird2.5-super restart
