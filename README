This old AlumniBook Project is a part of 
Buku Alumni Project ILUNI-FTUI.

1. Starting from Questionnaire,
2. Process 'em with information system
-- using PHP as front end and Delphi for data entry
3. And our final product is a book,
-- basically a printed version of this database

The book project is initiated by Aswil Nazir,
The questionnaire made by Zaenal Fanani,
Data collecting worked by Ade Tauhid.

I only contribute a small part,
it is the information system.

The original name is YellowBook.
I've renamed it to AlumniBook
since code rewrite using CI.

---------------------
This old project is using CodeIgniter 1.6.1
Therefore you need PHP <= 5.2 ,
You may need to downgrade PHP in your system.

As the project has stopped in 2007,
I'm uploading it for legacy purpose only.

I currently (2011) continue this project
in other framework for learning purpose.

Have fun

Firebird Instruction

There is a sample database with fixtures that you can use.
First, extract sample database,
then add aliases in your firebird.

$ gzip -d YellowBook.sample.fdb.gz

Add aliases in 
/etc/firebird/2.5/aliases.conf
IluniBook = /var/www/your_directory/YellowBook.sample.fdb

$ /etc/init.d/firebird2.5-super restart
